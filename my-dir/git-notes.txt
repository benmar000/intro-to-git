Git Terms

Life Cycle of files as they navigate through Git
- Untracked
- Tracked 
    Tracked and untracked means whether Git has added the file
    to the repository
    All files start as untracked


- Staged
    Means a few things: 
    - it is now Tracked
    - it will be included in the next commit 
- Committed
    - Represents a version
- Pushed
    - Uploaded to a remote repository
    - Some common remote repositories are GitHub and BitBucket

.gitignore
- as the name implies, .gitignore is a file where one can
  specify files which should be ignored (untracked) by gitignore
- We usually want logs, build files, and secrets to be 
  included in our .gitignore
